Practice for me and Arthur
This is just for practice.
Pastoree, we are writing every bit of code with comment to ensure that the other person understand.
To clone open vs code in new window
click clone repository and paste the link I send
or you can use the termina and type git clone and paste the link
when you are done, you open the terminal and add it by the command git add . (then enter)
next is the command git commit -m "Commit message"
finally git push origin main
